[php-vcr](https://php-vcr.github.io/) is a tool for recording and replaying outgoing requests, however it has had ["Privacy aware" marked as "soon"](https://php-vcr.github.io/#page-nav-Features) for quite some time now. Whenever I test my APIs, there will often be some sensitive information such as keys or passwords in the recordings. Up until now, I've had a separate script to always remove sensitive data before getting checked into version control.

I got tired of having to always sanitize the data, so this is a quick and dirty solution until php-vcr officially supports "private" recordings.

## Installation

Install the package through [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```bash
composer require --deb allejo/php-vcr-sanitizer
```

## Usage

After your VCR instance has been turned on, call `VCRCleaner::enable()` and pass whatever URL parameters or headers you don't want to be recorded in your fixtures.

```php
VCR::turnOn();
VCR::insertCassette('...');

VCRCleaner::enable(array(
    'ignoreUrlParameters' => array(
        'apiKey',
    ),
    'ignoreHeaders' => array(
        'X-Api-Key',
    ),
    'bodyScrubbers' => array(function($body) {
        return preg_replace('/<password.*<\/password>/', 'REDACTED', $body);
    }),
));
```

## How it Works

When VCR is looking for recordings to playback, VCRCleaner uses modified "matchers" to check everything except for the fields you've marked as sensitive.

### Hiding Headers

Let's say you set the `X-Api-Key` header to `SuperToast`. In your recording, the header you specified will be saved as null.

```yaml
-
    request:
        method: GET
        url: 'https://www.example.com/search'
        headers:
            Host: www.example.com
            X-Api-Key: null
            X-Type: application/vcr
    response:
        status:
            http_version: '1.1'
            code: '404'
            message: 'Not Found'
        headers: ~
        body: "...response body..."
```

### Hiding URL Parameters

Notice how `apiKey=yourSecretApiKey` is stripped away in your recording. During your VCR playback, it'll look for matching requests *without* the `apiKey` parameter.

```yaml
# Your cURL call to: https://www.example.com/search?q=keyword&apiKey=yourSecretApiKey
# gets recorded like so,
-
    request:
        method: GET
        url: 'https://www.example.com/search?q=keyword'
        headers:
            Host: www.example.com
    response:
        status:
            http_version: '1.1'
            code: '404'
            message: 'Not Found'
        headers: ~
        body: "...response body..."
```

### Hiding body contents

Unlike ignoring headers or URL parameters, scrubbing information from the request body makes use of an array of callbacks. The result of each function is passed on to the next function.

Notice how `<password>Hunter2</password>` has been stripped away from the request body. The callbacks take the body as a string parameter, the modified result has to be returned.

```php
VCRCleaner::enable(
    array(
        'bodyScrubbers' => array(
            function ($body) {
                $parameters = array();

                parse_str($body, $parameters);
                unset($parameters['password']);

                return http_build_query($parameters);
            },
        ),
    )
);
```

```yaml
# You POST request to `https://www.example.com/search` with a body of
# `username=AzureDiamond&password=hunter2` gets recorded like so,
-
    request:
        method: POST
        url: 'https://www.example.com/search'
        headers:
            Host: www.example.com
        body: 'username=AzureDiamond'
    response:
        status:
            http_version: '1.1'
            code: '404'
            message: 'Not Found'
        headers: ~
        body: '...response body...'
```
